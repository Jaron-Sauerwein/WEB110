        <p>Docents are the lifeblood of the Kansas City Automotive Museum. They are the bards of automotive history, keeping the literal traditions of car culture past burning brightly in the present. The sweat of their brows moisturizes the fertile soil upon which our beautiful monument to car history can grow. The docent is indispensable to an automotive museum - they are the visitor’s point of contact, the grunt work behind every event, and the historians who interpret automotive tomes. If you feel like this could describe you, read on.</p>

      <section class="Requirements">
      <h2>What is Required to Become a Docent?</h2>
       <p>The first and most important qualification for any potential Kansas City Automotive Museum docent is a deep and abiding love of cars, trucks or motorcycles. That automotive passion is the bedrock upon which the rest of docent training is founded. The museum can teach you to be more organized, more outgoing, and more knowledgeable - but we can’t force you to care about the classic car as an art form. If you have a lover for classic cars or bikes, than you are already well on your way to becoming a museum docent.<br><br>
          To determine what requirements you should meet to be the best docent possible, you need to first identify what expertise you plan to bring to the position. Prospective docents that are gregarious, love meeting new people and have four or more hours to volunteer per week are probably best suited to become regular scheduled museum tour docents, who give tours around the museum to our visitors. Prospective docents who are more introverted but have a wealth of mechanical skills or knowledge may be best prepared to work on restoring and maintaining the museum’s ever-growing fleet of permanently donated vehicles. Those who have less time to devote to the museum would probably best serve as special tour or special event docents, being called upon to contribute their skills towards setting up and executing our variety of special events every year or coming in only to give tours to large groups that require multiple docents.</p>

       <h2>What are Some Current Docent Projects?</h2> 
         <p>This coming Sunday is actually one of the biggest days of the year for a Kansas City Automotive Museum docent - our biggest car event of the calendar, The Great Car Show, is slated for July 27th. Being a blue-collar event with a concourse vibe, the event requires a huge time investment from both employees and volunteers like. Starting on Friday the 25th, our docents will be present at the World War I museum and memorial to mark out the parking spots for the show on Sunday. On Saturday, all of the materials needed for the show will be loaded into a box truck by our volunteers to prepare for the big day. Finally, on at 5 AM on Sunday, the lawn of the World War I mall transforms into the show field thanks to the diligent effort of our volunteers. While this show is a huge commitment, the payoff in seeing a world-class automotive event take shape in Kansas City has been immeasurably vindicating.<br><br> Another sizable docent project is the museum’s 1928 Auburn sedan. This car was restored by local Kansas City owners in the 1970s, but had recently fallen into disrepair. A cohort of mechanically-inclined docents have taken on the task of bringing this car back to its full glory, restoring its stately looks and bringing the powertrain back up to snuff so as to make it possible to use this vehicle to give demonstration rides to those who have never experienced a pre-war era car.</p>

     <p>Of course, the below is but a selection of what docents do on a daily basis. Even as a docent myself I can’t predict exactly what it is that you would find most fulfilling in volunteering at the automotive museum - every volunteer’s journey is different. What I can say with certainty is that every car enthusiast can find something to do at the Kansas City Automotive Museum that will help them feel more fulfilled. If you love classic cars, the automotive museum gives you an opportunity to contribute back to the hobby that has brought you so much joy - and that is motivation enough for us docents.</p>
