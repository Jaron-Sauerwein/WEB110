          <p>I grew up in rural Fort Scott, Kansas - a town that was very beautiful but was also very boring for a young child. I was always infatuated with the resourcefulness of mankind - I was a huge fan of the development of anything with an internal combustion engine, and you can read more about my volunteer activities <a href="volunteer.html" class="volunteerlink">here</a>. When my family visited the city, I would marvel at the huge skyscrapers and cavernous shopping malls that mere humans designed and constructed. I loved my home town, but I was also well aware of some of the reasons that the town was devoid of many of my passions - it had been left behind, a relic of the past unsuccessful in courting the future. While I hold a great deal of appreciation and reverence for history, I realized from a young age that an unwillingness to embrace the new is a trait that holds back many from their unrealized potential.

         <h2>Early Career</h2>
            <p>I worked a variety of different positions during my school years.
            </p>
            <!--The required unordered list has been placed here.-->
            <ul>
                <li>I spent my first few summers working a concession stand at a little league ball park, making nachos and hot dogs for parents and family members who were enjoying the game and the fleeting moments of early childhood, cheering on the wins and storing away the losses as motivation for future campaigns.</li> 
                <li>I would later work in a normal retail job for a college student, as a stocker and a cashier at Hobby Lobby, where I had to make split-second decisions, manage high-stress situations, and make financial calculations with no margin for error.</li> 
                <li> One summer I was blessed to find an unusual job that I really enjoyed - I worked as a dispatcher for a limousine company called K-MO Limo. I thoroughly enjoyed calling in to the drivers, being their liaison with the customer and ensuring that the ordered limo or black-car was at the airport terminal ready to go as soon as our customer’s flight touched ground. It was exciting - I felt like I was responsible for making sure that numerous business meetings went down smoothly, and that hundreds of professionals and merrymakers found Kansas City to their liking.</li>

         <h2>The TreviPay Years</h2>

          <figcaption>Aloha from Hawaii Day at TreviPay!</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>My primary career experience has been with TreviPay in their Accounts Payable department, and that seven years of experience has had great influence in shaping me as a professional. I learned how to deal with high-stress situations and how to communicate the cold, hard necessities of business in an empathetic manner. I worked closely with technology, seeing the rapid-fire change of platforms and the lightning fast development that even a medium-sized company was able to enact at a moment’s notice. I learned that, while we were underdogs of the industry in terms of pure capital and name identity, we were able to leverage high levels of technological advancement and a passion to see our customers succeed to the point that we were outcompeting the titans of the industry. As my previous position was naturally outmoded and my inevitable departure came in to clear view, I took note as to the lessons that I had learned here and decided to make them key tenets of the way that I would look at my career going forward.

         <h2>Onwards to a Brighter Future</h2>
          <p>I am pursuing the future via technology. It wasn’t a lack of desire to do my previous job that drove me to continue my education,  but rather, it was a desire to embrace the future - to be a trailblazer and a driving force into the great unknown. I find programming to be peaceful and tranquil, a way to build something new. I think that the driving force within me sees a Computer Information Systems degree as a way to further humanity, and I find that very appealing.
