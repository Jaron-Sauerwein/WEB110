              <p>One of the passions that has run continuously throughout my life is my love of  the automobile. From first grade, when I received the Encyclopedia of American Cars as an Easter present and memorized it front to back, I had a deep knowledge and passion for cars. However, my early years were fraught with the feeling of being a square peg forced into a round hole - I loved to learn about cars and memorize their histories, but that didn’t help me in school or endear me to my classmates. I often wondered if I would ever find an avenue to put my knowledge to good use. But once in college, I discovered a wonderful place.</p>

            <p>The Kansas City Automotive Museum is a 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to keeping the history of the Kansas City automobile alive. The museum creates curated displays of classic and special interest cars as a means of achieving this common goal. All but just a few cars in the Kansas City Automotive Museum are privately owned, meaning that their display is temporary and that the loving owners will get to continue enjoying the car after it is done with its time at the museum. The cars are paired with “reader-boards,” large poster-like displays that relate the car’s history to Kansas City.</p>
            <p>The automotive museum’s goals are threefold:</p>
            <!--The ordered list stipulated in the assignment has been inserted here.-->
            <ol>
             <li>To preserve the automobiles of Kansas City</li>
             <li>To promote the growth of car culture and the classic and special interest car hobbies</li>
             <li>To display Kansas City’s rich automotive heritage</li>
            </ol>
            <p>One of the key ways that the automotive museum achieves its goals is via day-to-day operations, allowing customers to enter the museum and receive a tour from one of our volunteer tour guides, known as docents.</p>

        <h2>What Does it Mean to be a Docent?</h2>

             </figure>     
             <p>My primary role at the Automotive Museum is that of a docent. While giving tours to customers may be our primary task, it is far from the only contribution that docents make to the museum. In my time volunteering there, I have:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Developed a number of QR code-based digital tours </li>
             <li>Aided in writing reader-boards for vehicles</li>
             <li>Scheduled owners to bring in vehicles  for display</li>
             <li>Drove museum-owned vehicles to events</li>
             <li>Helped orchestrate car shows and other events</li>
             <li>Filmed short videos giving information about monthly displays</li>
            </ul>
             <p>The sky really is the limit for docent participation. For those with a love of classic cars, the position of docent frees you to explore your hobby in a multitude of ways that you never thought possible.</p>

        <h2>The Real Reason I Volunteer</h2>
             <p>At the end of the day, the true story of car enthusiasm isn’t just about gears and gasoline - it’s a story of people. Every time I slide behind the wheel of a car at the museum to move it in, I become aware that I am gripping the same wheel that was held by countless others before who saw all the moments of the last century - the World Wars, the moon landing, the fall of the Berlin wall, and so on. </p>

             <img class="image" src="IMG_0851.jpeg" width="700em" height="auto" alt="A picture of Jaron Sauewrein and his friend from the Automotive Museum DeSean Anderson with their matching grey VW Passats. Fourteen model years seperate these two cars.">
             <figcaption>One of the great people that I have met through the museum is my friend DeSean, depicted here with his 2004 VW Passat. Our two Passats are seperated in age by 14 model years.</figcaption>
             </figure>     
             <p>Much more importantly, though, the museum has put in me in contact with so many excellent individuals. I work with a talented team of other docents and employees, each with their own unique experiences to share. Every day I work at the museum I see  a stream of locals and vacationers, and I learn nearly as much from them as they do from me. I’ve been lucky enough to give tours to travelers from as far off as Spain, Czech Republic, Chile, and Japan. Each tells me something about their local car enthusiast culture, from the excitement that a group of Brazilian car guys expressed when telling me about the Chevrolet Chevette they were working to restore at home to the wistful story related to me by an elderly Russian lady who remembered watching soviet GAZ Chaika limousines roll out of their factory onto a street that was on her walk home from school in the early 1960s. Stories like these would never graced my ears if it hadn’t been for the opportunity that I’ve had through the museum.</p>

             <!--The external link to the Kansas City Automotive Museum website is located within this paragraph, identifiable by again showing in italics.-->
             <p>Aside from the work that we do giving tours every day, the Kansas City Auto Museum also works towards growing car culture through a variety of special events throughout the year. These range from the Great Car Show, which is occurring this year on July 27th, to our annual Breakfast with Santa pancake party for Kansas City’s children in December. These events are a great way for us to reach out to the community and keep them engaged with the historic side of car culture. Even more vitally, these events bring kids and teens out to see the cars, and perhaps will inspire them to get into the hobby in the future. If you’re interested in joining us for one of our many events, go <a class="external link" href="https://kansascityautomuseum.com/events-gallery/">here</a> to see our detailed schedule.</p>

         <h2>The Future of the Museum</h2>
             <figure>
             <img class="imageleft" src="legacyinmotion.jpeg" width="800em" height="auto" alt="A rendering of the future of the auto museum">
             <figcaption>Hopefully the new home of the Kansas City Automotive Museum!</figcaption>     
             </figure>
             <p>Currently, the Kansas City Automotive Museum is at a pivotal crossroads. The board of the museum has set an ambitious goal of building a new facility at the corner of 31st Street and Southwest Boulevard in the downtown area. The new building will be more than three times the size of the current space in Olathe, and thus will enable us to build a much more complete display of automobiles. However, it is going to take a huge effort to accomplish this. As the museum closes in on its financial goals, it will need the concentrated effort of every volunteer and employee to make this dream a reality.</p>

             </figure>     
             <p>I can’t image a scenario in which I am not involved with the Kansas City Automotive Museum. I am fully dedicated to bringing the new building into reality because I have seen and appreciated the great difference that having this epicenter of car culture has brought into my life. I know somewhere out there in the expanse of the Kansas City metro area, there is a young boy or girl who is just like I was and feels like they have no purpose. It is for them that I show up every weekend, to dust off the cars and swap stories with the visitors. I know that every time I strain to push a two ton ‘58 Cadillac into the very back corner of the museum or get dowsed with rain picking up signage for a canceled Cars and Coffee, I am building something that will last far beyond my lifetime. In the end, that’s all the thanks I need.</p>
